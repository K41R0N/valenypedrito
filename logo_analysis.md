| Color | Hex Code | Usage in Logo |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Bright Yellow | #FFD700 / #FFC107 | Sun circle, "GREENLAND" text |

### Typography Style
- "GREENLAND" uses a **bold, playful serif** with slight curves and warmth
- "VILLAGE" uses a **clean, friendly sans-serif** with rounded edges
- Overall feel: **Approachable, fun, family-friendly** - NOT corporate

### Illustrated Elements
1. **Goat mascot** - friendly, simple line-art style with personality
2. **Sun** - warm yellow circle, partially behind elements (creates depth)
3. **Tree** - organic, hand-drawn feel with multiple green tones
4. **Decorative vines/ribbons** - flowing green curves that frame the logo
5. **Leaves** - scattered organic shapes
6. **Red berries/fruits** - small accent dots on tree

### Design Characteristics
- **Organic shapes** - nothing is perfectly geometric
- **Layered composition** - elements overlap naturally
- **Hand-drawn aesthetic** - imperfect, warm, inviting
- **Curved banner** - the green "GREENLAND VILLAGE" banner has soft, rounded edges
- **Flowing vines** - decorative elements that add movement and whimsy
- **Warm and inviting** - feels like a friendly farm/park, not a corporate entity

### Mood & Personality
- Playful and joyful
- Family-friendly and approachable
- Natural and organic
- Warm and welcoming
- Whimsical but not childish
- Farm/nature inspired

## Design System Implications for Website

### What to Change
1. **Remove** flat, corporate gradients → Add illustrated backgrounds
2. **Replace** generic stock photos → Use illustrated scenes or warm, candid photos
3. **Update** buttons to have organic, rounded shapes with playful hover effects
4. **Add** decorative vine/leaf elements as section dividers
5. **Incorporate** sun motif as recurring accent
6. **Use** the goat mascot as a friendly guide throughout the site
7. **Create** wavy, organic section separators (not straight lines)
8. **Add** subtle texture/grain to backgrounds for warmth
9. **Use** more yellow as a primary accent (it's prominent in the logo)

### Typography Recommendations
- Headlines: A playful, rounded font (like Baloo 2, Quicksand, or Nunito)
- Body: A friendly sans-serif (like Nunito, Lato, or Open Sans)
- Avoid: Corporate fonts like Inter, Roboto, or anything too geometric

### Interaction Style
- Bouncy, playful animations
- Elements that feel alive (subtle movements)
- Hover effects that delight (not just color changes)
- Scroll animations that reveal content in a fun way
